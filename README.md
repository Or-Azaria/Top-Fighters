# Top-Fighters

# Description 
Top-Fighters is a website that provides users with information about all events in the UFC world, as well as easy access to fighter rankings and more.

# Project flow 

The development of this website had its challenges, including:

* Choosing a reliable API that provided accurate and up-to-date information about UFC events and fighters.
* Attempting to implement a betting feature for each fight event.
* Applying object-oriented programming concepts to the codebase.

Despite these difficulties, there were also things that went well:

* A clear vision of what was wanted from the website from the start.
* Using a wireframe document to guide the building process and make it more comfortable and easy.
